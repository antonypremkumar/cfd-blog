  <h1>Welcome to my C.F.D. website!</h1>
  <p>I'm glad you're here. Shall we learn CFD ? ðŸŽ‰</p>
  <p>
    According to Versteeg, Computational fluid dynamics or CFD is the analysis of systems involving
    fluid flow, heat transfer and associated phenomena such as chemical reactions
    by means of computer-based simulation.

  <h1>The Basics</h1>
  <p>CFD tries to solve a initial-boundary value problem a partial differential equation. This equation is called the Navier Stokes equation.</p>
